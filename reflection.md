What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Unit testing took a little while to get used to. It was a good rule to keep in mind that I shouldn't be using any complicated code like if statements, because there were a couple times when I was tempted to whip that out. But probably also this is useful for when the code is way more layered and complicated. Thank you to my lovely peer Hanna Wheeler (shoutout) for helping me with this assignment. The print manifest test was particularly difficult.
